# Best Restaurants

#### _C#, .NET: Best Restaurants, 01/15/2020_

## Description
A website where users can add their favorite restaurants based on the type of cuisine they offer.

## Application should have:

* Add a Cuisine class. Build out all CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for this class. Remember that "Read" means to view a particular cuisine and to list out all of the cuisines.
* Add a Restaurant class. Build out all CRUD functionality for this class.
* Add properties other than name to your Restaurant class so that you can display descriptive information about the restaurants.
* Make the connection between a cuisine and a restaurant in the database. A cuisine can have many restaurants, but a restaurant can only be attached to one cuisine.
* Allow a user to search for all of a cuisine's restaurants.
Extra:
* Now your application allows for users to review restaurants. Build out a Review class and make the relationship in the database so that a restaurant has many reviews. Pretend that the users who are reviewing the website are different from the user who added the restaurant.
* Display all of the reviews at the bottom of the restaurant's page.
